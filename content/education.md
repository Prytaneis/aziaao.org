Thank you for your interest in increasing your knowledge of the Assessment profession.

Please increase your awareness of financial assistance for educational program that can be applied for through the Bruce Belon Scholarship funds. This may be helpful to those with smaller County budgets. Bruce Belon was President of the National IAAO organization from September 1997-1998 who passed suddenly and unexpectedly in at the annual conference. Bruce was a strong supporter and co-founder of the current Arizona Chapter, a Department of Revenue Colleague and a dear friend to many in the profession of tax assessment. In his memory for many years now, AZ IAAO has dedicated funds which are available to all members.

If there is a course or educational offering that you would like the chapter to consider hosting, please email the Education Committee Co-Chairs, Terri Eddie or Dan Garant with your request.
