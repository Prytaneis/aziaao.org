There are plenty of reasons, but most important is that the Chapter hosts IAAO appraisal courses here in Arizona. Prior to 1996 it was extremely rare to have an IAAO course available in Arizona. Typically appraisers would have to travel across the country to get training which made getting education or designation much more expensive, time consuming and difficult. Bringing the IAAO educational programs to you is the primary reason the Chapter exists.
