Please plan to join us at Arizona IAAO’s next Training Webinar on Tuesday, December 20th from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

December’s webinar will cover Quality Control, particularly techniques used by Arizona jurisdictions to maintain a level of excellence through planning, continuous review, and needed correction.  Presenters Kylie Humphrey from Maricopa County, Gary Waters from Mohave County, and Jeremy Pittman from Coconino County will demonstrate quality control processes built around Esri Canada’s “Assessment Analyst”, Harris’ “RealWare”, and Tyler’s “Assessor” Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) systems.  Topics covered include how and why quality control checks are created and managed, general techniques for coordinating the review and correction of quality issues, as well as a consideration of the differing perspectives of stakeholders in the quality control process.  An effort will be made to disseminate hard-won tips relating to quality control appropriate for all of Arizona’s jurisdictions.

NOTE: If attending this webinar for DOR continuing education credit, please coordinate with your local DOR training liaison.
