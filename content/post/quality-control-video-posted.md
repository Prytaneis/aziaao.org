Below is a video recording of the Quality Control training webinar hosted by the Arizona IAAO chapter on December 20th, 2022.  Presenters Kylie Humphrey from Maricopa County, Gary Waters from Mohave County, and Jeremy Pittman from Coconino County will demonstrate quality control processes built around Esri Canada’s “Assessment Analyst”, Harris’ “RealWare”, and Tyler’s “Assessor” Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) systems.  Topics covered included how and why quality control checks are created and managed, general techniques for coordinating the review and correction of quality issues, as well consideration of the differing perspectives of stakeholders in the quality control process.
