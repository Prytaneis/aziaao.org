title: 'County Highlight:  La Paz County'

---
La Paz County was formed on January 1, 1983. Since then tourism and agriculture have become the leaders in the countyâ€™s economy. The towns of Parker and Quartzsite are the main population centers, as well as the main business areas for residents and winter visitors.

La Paz County offers residents and visitors a combination of water and desert recreational activities. In the Parker area, water recreation is king. The 17-mile Parker Strip offers some of the best water for skiing, boating, jet skiing, wave-running, and swimming, as well as excellent fishing in the western United States. Desert rats will enjoy miles and miles of off-road trails, old mines and ghost towns, and beautiful springtime wildflower displays.

Quartzsite is known for its winter season gem and mineral shows. More than 1 million folks visit this community each year to take part in these shows. La Paz County offers a quiet pollution free haven to winter visitors escaping the snow and ice in the Northern and Midwestern states.
