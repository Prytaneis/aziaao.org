We would like to thank everyone who helped make our October 5th Lunch & Learn a success!  We received lots of compliments on the education sessions and several volunteers.

Below are several of the presentations given during the session.  Note that those pursuing continuing education credit with the Department of Revenue will need coordinate with your jurisdiction's DOR training liaison before viewing the following videos for credit.

* An overview of Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) eligible properties presented by Arizona Department of Revenue's Darren Rasmussen {{< youtube "Yz6siLbSL4o" >}}
* An overview of Ratio Studies presented by Arizona I.A.A.O. President Kelly Murphy and Director Bret McKee {{< youtube "jZfv64CHZsY" >}}
* An overview of Tiny Homes presented by Arizona I.A.A.O. Secretary Barbara Gomez {{< youtube "ihgWyF3Jknw" >}}

Again, we hope those in attendance enjoyed the Lunch & Learn and look forward to seeing more of our members during our next session in December.
